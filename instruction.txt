Step 1: Create the Database

Using a database management tool (e.g., phpMyAdmin) create a new database named "Laravel."

Step 2: Run Migrations in Laravel

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the root directory of your Laravel project using the cd command. Replace /path/to/your/laravel/project with the actual path to your Laravel project.

cd /path/to/your/laravel/project

Run the migration command to create the necessary database tables:

php artisan migrate

Step 3: Run the Frontend React Project

Open a new terminal window.

Navigate to your React project's root directory. For example, if your React project is in a folder named "myapp," you can do the following:

cd /path/to/your/react/project/myapp

npm start

http://localhost:3000

php artisan serve
